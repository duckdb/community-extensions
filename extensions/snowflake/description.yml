install_notes: |
  **Important:** This extension requires the Apache Arrow ADBC Snowflake driver to function properly.
  
  After installing the extension, you must manually set up the ADBC driver. You can either:
  
  1. **Use the setup script** (recommended):
     ```bash
     curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iqea-ai/duckdb-snowflake/stable/scripts/download_adbc_driver.sh
     bash download_adbc_driver.sh
     ```
     This script downloads the platform-specific driver library (`libadbc_driver_snowflake.so`) 
     from the Apache Arrow ADBC releases and places it in the appropriate location.
  
  2. **Manual setup**: Follow the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/iqea-ai/duckdb-snowflake) 
     on GitHub for manual installation and platform-specific driver setup.
  
  For detailed installation instructions, please refer to:

  hello_world: |
    -- Install and load the extension
    INSTALL snowflake FROM community;
    LOAD snowflake;
    
    -- Create a Snowflake secret with password authentication
    CREATE SECRET my_snowflake (
        TYPE snowflake,
        ACCOUNT 'your-account',
        USER 'your-username',
        PASSWORD 'your-password',
        DATABASE 'your-database'
    );
    
    -- Query Snowflake data using pass-through query function
    SELECT * FROM snowflake_query(
        'SELECT * FROM customers WHERE state = ''CA''',
        'my_snowflake'
    );
    
    -- Attach Snowflake database for direct SQL access
    ATTACH '' AS sf (TYPE snowflake, SECRET my_snowflake, READ_ONLY);
    SELECT * FROM sf.schema.customers WHERE state = 'CA';

  extended_description: |
    This community-maintained extension allows DuckDB to connect to Snowflake using Arrow ADBC drivers. 
    It provides seamless connectivity between DuckDB and Snowflake, supporting multiple authentication methods 
    (password, external browser/SSO, key pair), predicate pushdown optimization, and comprehensive SQL operations.
    
    **Features:**
    - Multiple authentication methods (Password, External Browser/SSO, Key Pair)
    - Direct SQL passthrough via `snowflake_query()` function
    - ATTACH support for mounting Snowflake databases as DuckDB catalogs
    - Predicate pushdown optimization (optional)
    - Hybrid queries: join Snowflake tables with local DuckDB tables
    - Full DML read operations: SELECT with WHERE, JOIN, aggregations, subqueries
    
    **Prerequisites:** The Apache Arrow ADBC Snowflake driver must be installed separately. After 
    installing the extension, run `scripts/download_adbc_driver.sh` from the extension repository 
    to download the platform-specific driver. For detailed setup and usage instructions, visit the 
    [extension repository](https://github.com/iqea-ai/duckdb-snowflake).
