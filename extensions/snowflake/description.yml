install_notes: |
  **Important:** This extension requires DuckDB 1.4.3 and the Apache Arrow ADBC Snowflake driver to function properly.
  
  **You must install the ADBC driver separately after installing this extension.** The extension will not work without the driver.
  
  For complete installation instructions, platform-specific setup, and troubleshooting, please refer to the official documentation:
  
  **[ADBC Driver Installation Guide](https://github.com/iqea-ai/duckdb-snowflake#adbc-driver-setup)**
  
  The documentation includes:
  - Step-by-step installation instructions for all platforms
  - Automated setup scripts
  - Manual installation procedures
  - Driver location requirements
  - Troubleshooting common issues

  hello_world: |
    -- Install and load the extension
    INSTALL snowflake FROM community;
    LOAD snowflake;
    
    -- Create a Snowflake secret with password authentication
    CREATE SECRET my_snowflake (
        TYPE snowflake,
        ACCOUNT 'your-account',
        USER 'your-username',
        PASSWORD 'your-password',
        DATABASE 'your-database'
    );
    
    -- Query Snowflake data using pass-through query function
    SELECT * FROM snowflake_query(
        'SELECT * FROM customers WHERE state = ''CA''',
        'my_snowflake'
    );
    
    -- Attach Snowflake database for direct SQL access
    ATTACH '' AS sf (TYPE snowflake, SECRET my_snowflake, READ_ONLY);
    SELECT * FROM sf.schema.customers WHERE state = 'CA';

  extended_description: |
    This community-maintained extension allows DuckDB to connect to Snowflake using Arrow ADBC drivers. 
    It provides seamless connectivity between DuckDB and Snowflake, supporting multiple authentication methods 
    (password, external browser/SSO, key pair), predicate pushdown optimization, and comprehensive SQL operations.
    
    **Features:**
    - Multiple authentication methods (Password, External Browser/SSO, Key Pair)
    - Direct SQL passthrough via `snowflake_query()` function
    - ATTACH support for mounting Snowflake databases as DuckDB catalogs
    - Predicate pushdown optimization (optional)
    - Hybrid queries: join Snowflake tables with local DuckDB tables
    - Full DML read operations: SELECT with WHERE, JOIN, aggregations, subqueries
    
    **Prerequisites:** The Apache Arrow ADBC Snowflake driver must be installed separately. 
    **See the [ADBC Driver Installation Guide](https://github.com/iqea-ai/duckdb-snowflake#adbc-driver-setup) 
    for complete setup instructions.** For comprehensive usage examples, authentication methods, and 
    advanced features, visit the [extension repository](https://github.com/iqea-ai/duckdb-snowflake).
