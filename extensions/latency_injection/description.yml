  extended_description: |
    This extension injects log-normal distribution latency to all types of filesystem operations, which could be used to local benchmark.
    It supports a few key features:
    - Supports wrapping user-requested filesystems, so users don't need to make any code change.
    - Supports simulated IO operation latency, via log-normal distribution.
    - Could be used together with rate_limit_fs to throttle operations if needed.
