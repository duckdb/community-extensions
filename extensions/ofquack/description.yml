  extended_description: |
    The Ofquack extension provides seamless integration between DuckDB and Oracle Fusion via WSDL-based SOAP calls.
    It allows you to run arbitrary SQL queries against Oracle Fusion database directly from DuckDB, inferring column names at runtime and returning all data as VARCHAR columnsâ€”as native DuckDB tables and as resultsets that can be directly consumed by downstream applications.
