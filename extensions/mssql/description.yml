    The mssql extension provides a DuckDB connector for Microsoft SQL Server using the native TDS protocol.

    The extension is experimental and may not cover all edge cases. Please report any issues on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/hugr-lab/mssql-extension).

    Features:
    - Native TDS protocol (no ODBC/JDBC required)
    - Schema, table, and view catalog integration
    - Projection and filter pushdown
    - TLS/SSL encrypted connections (encrypt parameter)
    - INSERT support with RETURNING clause
    - Connection pooling with configurable limits
    - DuckDB secret management for credentials

    Limitations:
    - Limited data type support (see documentation for details)
    - DML only INSERT operations supported
