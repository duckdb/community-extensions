  extended_description: >
    The MSOLAP extension allows DuckDB to connect to Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) and other OLAP data sources using the MSOLAP provider. It enables querying multidimensional and tabular models with DAX queries directly from DuckDB.
    
    
    The extension provides one main function:
    - `msolap(connection_string, dax_query)`: Execute a custom DAX query against an OLAP source
    
    
    This extension is particularly useful for data analysts who work with Microsoft Business Intelligence stack (SSAS, Power BI) and want to incorporate this data into their DuckDB workflows.
    
    
    *Note:* Current limitations include Windows-only support due to COM dependencies, limited data type conversion for complex OLAP types, and limited support for calculated measures and hierarchies. The extension requires Microsoft OLEDB provider for Analysis Services (MSOLAP.8) to be installed.
