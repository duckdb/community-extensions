    This extension provides functions for reading data and metadata from HDF5 files.

    Features:
    - `h5_tree()` table function for listing groups and datasets in the file.
    - `h5_read()` table function for reading datasets.
    - `h5_attributes()` table function for accessing attributes.
    - Multiple datasets: Read and combine multiple datasets in a single query.
    - Multi-dimensional arrays: Support for 1D-4D datasets.
    - Projection pushdown: Only reads datasets that are actually needed.
    - Index column: Optionally adds an `index` column that supports pushing down constant "range" like filters (`>`, `<=`, `BETWEEN`, etc), to allow efficient selective reads from datasets.
    - Can read datasets that are larger than memory.
