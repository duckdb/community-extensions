    The Sudan extension brings unified SQL access to Sudan's publicly available data across
    5 international APIs — World Bank, WHO, FAO, UNHCR, and ILO.

    Sudan is experiencing one of the world's largest humanitarian crises, yet its data is
    scattered across dozens of international APIs with incompatible formats. This extension
    enables analysts, researchers, and humanitarian workers to query demographics, economics,
    health, agriculture, displacement, and geospatial boundaries using standard SQL.

    **Data providers:**
    - **World Bank** — Development indicators, GDP, population, education
    - **WHO** — Health indicators, disease burden, mortality rates
    - **FAO** — Agricultural production, food security, land use
    - **UNHCR** — Refugees, IDPs, asylum seekers, displacement data
    - **ILO** — Employment, labor force, unemployment statistics

    **Key features:**
    - 12 SQL functions covering data retrieval, indicator search, and geospatial queries
    - Bilingual support (Arabic/English) for state names and provider metadata
    - Regional comparison with 8 neighboring countries (Egypt, Ethiopia, Chad, South Sudan, Eritrea, Libya, CAF)
    - Embedded GeoJSON boundaries for Sudan's 18 states (works offline)
    - In-memory response caching for efficient repeated queries
