  extended_description: |
    Aix enables efficient storage and querying of large chess game collections.
    A game's moves are encoded in a binary representation, and this extension
    [provides scalar functions](https://github.com/thomas-daniels/aix/blob/main/docs/functions.md) to decode and query these games directly within DuckDB.

    See the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/thomas-daniels/aix) or [blog post](https://thomasd.be/2026/02/01/aix-storing-querying-chess-games.html) for more details.
