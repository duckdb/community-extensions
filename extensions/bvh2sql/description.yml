    The BVH2SQL extension allows you to read BioVision Hierarchy (BVH) motion capture files
    directly into DuckDB for analysis and processing.

    **Features:**
    - Parse BVH hierarchy structure with joint offsets
    - Calculate absolute world positions for all joints using matrix transformations
    - Support for position channels (Xposition, Yposition, Zposition)
    - Support for rotation channels (Xrotation, Yrotation, Zrotation)
    - Efficient frame-by-frame processing
    - Returns data as a standard SQL table with columns: frame_id, time, joint_name, world_x, world_y, world_z, rot_x, rot_y, rot_z

    **Use Cases:**
    - Motion capture data analysis
    - Animation retargeting preparation
    - Character movement statistics
    - Biomechanics research
    - Game development data pipeline
