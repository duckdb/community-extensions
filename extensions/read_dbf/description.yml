  extended_description: |
    The read_dbf extension provides functions for reading DBF (dBase) files, which are commonly used in legacy applications and GIS data formats. It supports a wide range of DBF formats and field types, allowing you to easily integrate DBF data into your DuckDB queries.

    **Functions:**
    - `read_dbf(path)` - Read all rows from a DBF file

    **Output Schema:**
    The output schema will depend on the structure of the DBF file being read. Each column in the DBF file will be represented as a column in the output, with appropriate data types based on the field types defined in the DBF file.
