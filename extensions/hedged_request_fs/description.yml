    This extension enhances DuckDB filesystem capability by hedged request to cut down tail latency.

    - It supports all metadata and directory operations, the slow ones of which will be attempted hedged request to cut down tail latency.
    - Users are able to tune hedged requests trigger thresholds and max attempt counts.
