    This extension enhances DuckDB filesystem capability by hedged request to cut down tail latency.
    It supports a few key features:
    - It allows users to wrap an existing filesystem, so all later access behavior exactly the same without changing any code.
    - Support all metadata and directory operations, the slow ones of which will be attempted hedged request to cut down tail latency.
    - Hedged requests trigger thresholds and max attempt counts are configurable.
