    Duck Tails brings git-aware data analysis capabilities to DuckDB, enabling sophisticated version-controlled data workflows. The extension provides three core capabilities:
    
    **Git Filesystem Access**: Use the `git://` protocol to access any file in your git repository at any commit, branch, or tag. This allows you to query historical data states, compare versions, and perform temporal analysis directly in SQL.
    
    **Repository Metadata Queries**: Query git repository information directly with table functions like `git_log()`, `git_branches()`, and `git_tags()`. Analyze commit histories, track development patterns, and integrate repository metadata into your analytical workflows.
    
    **Text Diff Analysis**: Comprehensive text diffing capabilities with functions like `diff_text()`, `read_git_diff()`, and `text_diff_stats()`. Analyze changes between file versions, track configuration drift, and perform code change analysis.
    
    Key functions include:
    - `git_log([path])` - Query commit history
    - `git_branches([path])` - List repository branches  
    - `git_tags([path])` - List repository tags
    - `diff_text(old, new)` - Compute text differences
    - `read_git_diff(file1, [file2])` - Structured diff analysis
    - `text_diff_lines(diff)` - Parse diff into line-by-line changes
    - `text_diff_stats(old, new)` - Diff statistics and metrics
    
    The extension supports mixed file systems, allowing you to combine git://, local files, S3, and other DuckDB-supported protocols in a single query. Built with libgit2 for robust git operations and comprehensive error handling.
