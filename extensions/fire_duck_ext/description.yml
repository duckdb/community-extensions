    The fire_duck_ext extension enables direct SQL access to Google Cloud
    Firestore collections from DuckDB. It supports reading data with
    firestore_scan(), writing with firestore_update() and firestore_delete(),
    batch operations, array transforms, collection group queries, and DuckDB
    secret management for credential storage. Filter pushdown optimizes
    queries by sending supported filters directly to Firestore.

    ## Type Mapping
    - `string` → VARCHAR
    - `integer` → BIGINT
    - `double` → DOUBLE
    - `boolean` → BOOLEAN
    - `timestamp` → TIMESTAMP
    - `array` → LIST
    - `map` → VARCHAR (JSON string)
    - `vector` → ARRAY(DOUBLE, N) (embedding)
    - `null` → NULL
    - `geoPoint` → STRUCT(latitude DOUBLE, longitude DOUBLE)
    - `reference` → VARCHAR
    - `bytes` → BLOB

    ## Schema Inference
    When you call `firestore_scan()`, the extension automatically infers the
    schema by sampling up to 100 documents from the collection. For each
    field, it determines the DuckDB type using a voting system: the most
    common non-null Firestore type across the sampled documents wins. Fields
    that do not appear in every sampled document are marked nullable.

    For array fields, element types are also inferred by sampling elements
    across documents and selecting the most common element type. If a field
    is only ever null across all samples, it defaults to VARCHAR.

    A virtual `__document_id` column (VARCHAR) is always added as the first
    column, containing the Firestore document ID (or the full document path
    for collection group queries).

    Documents with heterogeneous field types are handled gracefully at read
    time: values that cannot be converted to the inferred column type are
    returned as NULL.

    ## Null Semantics
    Both missing fields and explicit Firestore null values appear as NULL in
    DuckDB. There is no way to distinguish between the two on read.

    Writing NULL to a field sets it to an explicit Firestore null value; it
    does not delete the field from the document.

    `WHERE field IS NULL` is not pushed down to Firestore because Firestore's
    IS_NULL operator only matches fields that exist and are explicitly null,
    while DuckDB treats missing fields as NULL. `WHERE field IS NOT NULL` is
    pushed down safely.

    ## Batch Operations
    Batch updates and deletes group writes into requests of up to 500
    operations each using Firestore's batchWrite API. Note that batchWrite
    is not atomic: individual writes within the batch may succeed or fail
    independently. If batchWrite is unavailable (e.g., API key auth), the
    extension falls back to individual operations automatically.

    ## Collection Group Queries
    Use the `~collection` prefix to query across all subcollections with a
    given name. For example, `firestore_scan('~orders')` reads all documents
    from every subcollection named "orders" regardless of parent path.
